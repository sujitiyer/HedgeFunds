## Options Classification Strategy
Strategy developed for final project. Involves classifying and trading 10 DTE call options using Random Forest Classification. Trading options allowed us to boil down profit-gaining trades to a binary equation (either exercising the option and gaining a certain percentage in the underlying equity from the strike price with probability p or losing the option premium with probability 1 - p). 
## Neural Net Strategies
Using lagged factor inputs to create a strategy using two ReLU activated hidden layers and a linear output layer.
## Risk-Weighted Portfolios
Replicating Bridgewater's volatility-managed investment strategy by rebalancing away from high volatility assets and into low.
## Intangibles
The strategy was first described in Edmans (2011) “Does the stock market fully value intangibles? Employee satisfaction and equity prices.” The basic question is, does it matter if a firm’s employees are happy? And if so, does the stock market realize and value this?
## Size, Momentum, Beta Strategies
Using “The Center for Research in Securities Prices" (CRSP) to build basic factors. Size strategy is based off the principle that smaller companies tend to outperform. Momentum strategy is based off the principle that "winners" (high past returns) win and "losers" (low past returns) lose. Betting against Beta strategy is modeled after AQR's.
## CAPM
Understanding how to evaluate strategy returns using the CAPM model.
